# PI_3_Data_Analytics 
This milestone is the final individual Data Science project proposed by **Henry**  its target is to group programming and analytical concepts viewed during the Bootcamp.

On the provided source data set proposed to apply to cleanse and transform programming methods to optimize records for later uploading to a relational query program **MYSQL** and create a database.

Finally, by using a powerful visualization tool such as Power BI I have created an informative **Dashboard** where I will show my analytical skills developed through the course getting some insights from data.

## Topic: Airplane Crashes
The human race evolution brings many risks the aeronautical field is one of the most risky professions due to the fatidical results after any kind of accident. 
Throughtout this project I goning to analyse the data and extract relevant information about the amount of aircraft crashes during the last century aeronautical history and finally taking some conclusions based on their records.
